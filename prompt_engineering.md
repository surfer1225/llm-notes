notes on prompt engineering and other LLM related topics

## Prompt engineering
1. clear & specific instructions
- Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
    - Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, <tag> </tag>, :
- Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
    - e.g. json, xml, list
- Tactic 3: Check whether certain conditions are satisfied
    - e.g. if xx, write output in this way
- Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting
    - give actual example of how request / response looks like
- Tactic 5: give the model an identity
2. give model time to think
- Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task, so that model can follow each step
- Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out a solution before rushing into conclusion
    - e.g. if you want to check is a math solution is right or not, have model produce a solution then compare
    - say things like do not decide before you have computed the result

### Engineering guide
```
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPEN_API_KEY')

## This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs
client = openai.OpenAI()

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Model limitations
- Hallucination, to mitigate, find the relevant information -> then generate answer

## Iterative prompt development
Idea -> Implementation -> Experimental result -> Error analysis -> Idea

- Text is too long: Add things such as "Use at most 400 characters, 50 words"
- Text focusing on the wrong detail: give it focus
- Text in random format/structure: specify the format of output

## Summarizing
Try to focus on specific topics and use the above tactics to get more accurate answer

## Inferring
- Sentiment (positive/negative)
- Types of emotions (happy, impressed, grateful, jealous etc.)
```
prompt = f"""
Identify a list of emotions that the writer of the \
following review is expressing. Include no more than \
five items in the list. Format your answer as a list of \
lower-case words separated by commas.

Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
- Identify anger
```
prompt = f"""
Is the writer of the following review expressing anger?\
The review is delimited with triple backticks. \
Give your answer as either yes or no.

Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
- Identify anger
- Extract company & product
```
prompt = f"""
Identify the following items from the review text: 
- Item purchased by reviewer
- Company that made the item

The review is delimited with triple backticks. \
Format your response as a JSON object with \
"Item" and "Brand" as the keys. 
If the information isn't present, use "unknown" \
as the value.
Make your response as short as possible.
  
Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
- It is also possible to do all at the same time
```
prompt = f"""
Identify the following items from the review text: 
- Sentiment (positive or negative)
- Is the reviewer expressing anger? (true or false)
- Item purchased by reviewer
- Company that made the item

The review is delimited with triple backticks. \
Format your response as a JSON object with \
"Sentiment", "Anger", "Item" and "Brand" as the keys.
If the information isn't present, use "unknown" \
as the value.
Make your response as short as possible.
Format the Anger value as a boolean.

Review text: '''{lamp_review}'''

## Transform
- Make writing formal
- Translate to another language
```
for issue in user_messages:
    prompt = f"Tell me what language this is: ```{issue}```"
    lang = get_completion(prompt)
    print(f"Original message ({lang}): {issue}")

    prompt = f"""
    Translate the following  text to English \
    and Korean: ```{issue}```
    """
    response = get_completion(prompt)
    print(response, "\n")
```
- Grammar / Spelling check
```

  "The girl with the black and white puppies have a ball.",  # The girl has a ball.
  "Yolanda has her notebook.", # ok
  "Its going to be a long day. Does the car need it’s oil changed?",  # Homonyms

Got this for my daughter for her birthday cuz she keeps taking \
mine from my room.  Yes, adults also like pandas too.  She takes \
it everywhere with her, and it's super soft and cute.  One of the \
ears is a bit lower than the other, and I don't think that was \
designed to be asymmetrical. It's a bit small for what I paid for it \
though. I think there might be other options that are bigger for \
the same price.  It arrived a day earlier than expected, so I got \
to play with it myself before I gave it to my daughter.

## Expanding
- Brainstorming partner
- Temperature is the degree of freedom (e.g. if your favorite food is 53% pizza, 30% sushi, temperature of 0 will always give pizza, while 0.3 will sometimes give sushi)
- Do not spam
### Sample tasks
- Customize the automated reply to a customer email
```
# given the sentiment from the lesson on "inferring",
# and the original customer message, customize the email
sentiment = "negative"

# review for a blender

So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.
